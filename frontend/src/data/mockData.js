// ✅ REAL-TIME DATA SYSTEM ACTIVE
// 
// 🚀 This marketplace now uses 100% real-time data from sellers!
// 
// 📊 How it works:
// 1. Sellers upload cars via AddCarListing → Cars stored in CarContext + Backend
// 2. Buyers see real uploaded cars in BuyerDashboard → Live from CarContext  
// 3. Real-time updates when sellers add/edit/delete cars
// 4. No more mock data - everything is dynamic and user-generated
// 
// 🔄 CarContext manages all car data dynamically with backend integration

// This file is kept for reference but no longer exports mock data
// All components now use real data from the CarContext system
